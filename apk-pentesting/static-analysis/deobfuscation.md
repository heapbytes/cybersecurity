# Deobfuscation

## React native app

### &#x20; Beautify js code (non Hermes enabled)

React apps are bundled with js too, in order to read the js file, you can checkout the js file within:

`Resources -> assets -> index.android.bundle`

Since the js would be too long and most times it would give an timeout on online beautifiers, we'll use `npm install -g js-beautify` to beautify the code locally.

### &#x20; Beautify js code (Hermes compiled apks)

Apks that are compiled using Hermes engine have extra layer of security and we cannot read the `index.android.bundle` file.&#x20;

We can reverse the data to readble human format using [https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec)\
pip install it, then run&#x20;

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec          

hbc-decompiler index.android.bundle output.js
```
