# MITM proxy

We can try SSL pinning bypass OR watch all of our traffic of apk.

[https://github.com/niklashigi/apk-mitm](https://github.com/niklashigi/apk-mitm)\
\


## Install

`npm install -g apk-mitm`

This will install the module globally in your system, next we will patch our app with apk-mitm to intercept all traffic.

This is good since you won't need a rooted android to perform tests.



Patch APK

`apk-mitm ./myapk.apk`
